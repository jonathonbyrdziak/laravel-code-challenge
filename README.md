## DEMO

Access the demo site on Heroku here [https://tranquil-taiga-84689.herokuapp.com/](https://tranquil-taiga-84689.herokuapp.com/)

- DB Migrations are in place
- Table upgrades (issue #1 and #2) handle new installation as well as upgrading an existing installation
- Averaging widgets are done through the api interface and display varying methods of DB facade querying

## Setup

- Clone repository. (Do not fork.)
- Copy .env.example to .env and configure database settings.
- Run the following commands to get a functional and seeded application:
  ```
  php artisan key:generate
  php artisan migrate:fresh
  php artisan db:seed
  npm install
  npm run dev
  php artisan serve
  ```

## Code Challenges

The objectives outlined below should be completed and any resulting code should follow the code style of the project and have doc-blocks where applicable.

- Modify Owners table to include columns for number of addresses and cars associated with each owner.
- Modify Addresses table to include concatenated owner name and number of cars associated with each address.
- Modify Cars table to include concatenated owner name and address associated with each car.


- Build simple and reusable view/edit Vue.js components for owners, addresses, and cars and link them to the action buttons in each table. The displayed data should include associated entities. (Addresses and cars for the owner. Owner and cars for the address. Owner and address for the car.)
- Build a simple and reusable delete Vue.js component for owners, addresses, and cars. This should include a confirmation prompt.


- Create a route for owners that uses the DB facade (not Eloquent) to return the average number of addresses and cars, respectively, per user and add a component that displays the information above the table on the owners page.
- Create a route for addresses that uses the DB facade (not Eloquent) to return the average number of cars per address and add a component that displays the information above the table on the addresses page.
